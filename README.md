# PYTHON-BASICS
My journey in Python.
This repository contains basic python programs I'm currently learning. It will get updated as time goes by. The progress as to what I'm at or at least what level I'm currently at will be visible.

## Structure
* The filename indicates the problem.
* Programs can be run independently.
* Each program is written in a separate .py file.

## How to Run Python
1. Open terminal inside the repo folder.
2. Run:
   ```bash
    python filename.py
